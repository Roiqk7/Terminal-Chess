Welcome 2 Terminal Chess!

In this brief tutorial I will explain the rules of the game and how to play.
First of all all screens provide you with a list of commands that you can use.
It doesnt matter if you write the command as is eg. 'help', 'Help' or 'HELP'.
Each command also provides a shorter version of the command that you can use.
For example "help" can be written as 'h' or 'H'.

Let's say you are bored and want to play a quick game of chess. Once you open
the game you will be greeted with the main menu. Here you can choose the option
'Play'. Then you will be asked to pick a game mode. You can choose between
single player and multiplayer. In single player you will play against the AI
with 3 different difficulty levels. In multiplayer you can play against a friend.
Assuming you picked single player you will be asked to pick a difficulty level.
Select the difficulty level you want to play against and the game will start.

The game will randomly select your color so you will never know what color you
will be playing with. White always starts first. The game will display the board
and the pieces. You can move your pieces by typing the coordinates of the piece
you want to move and the coordinates of the square you want to move it to. Don't
worry if you don't know how the knight moves, the game will highlight the squares
where you can move the piece to. If you want to cancel the move just type 'c' or
'cancel'.

During the game you can type `q` to pause the game and want to save it. You can
also load a saved game or quit the game. Don't worry about not having enough save
slots. You have up to 3 available save slots which is more than the actual game
of chess... I think. Anyway... Have fun!
