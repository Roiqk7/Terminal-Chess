Goal: Create a simple demo where you can safely move across the app and have the basic GUI elements working.

- Add user input
- Add event system
- Once you can move around and everything is nice, add the actual Chess game and logic
        - Keep in mind that you would like to use Stockfish as an opponent
- Add credits to main menu and into all the docs etc.
