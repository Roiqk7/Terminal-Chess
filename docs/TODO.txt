Goal: Create a simple demo where you can safely move across the app and have the basic GUI elements working.

- New Event System using the Command pattern
        1. Make Event base class (command object)
                - And plenty smaller subclasses
        2. Event Handler class will be a singleton global center point of this system
                - It will have a submit() method that will take an Event object and
                put it into a submittedEvents queue
                - All the submitted events will then be passed to process() method
                which will call the execute() method of the event.
                - Once the event is executed, it will be removed from the queue
                and added to the eventStack. This will allow for undo/redo.



- Once you can move around and everything is nice, add the actual Chess game and logic
        - Keep in mind that you would like to use Stockfish as an opponent
- Once you have working Chess game, polish everything and beautify the application.
        - Also do not forget to add custom help menus and all the other stuff you promise in the docs
