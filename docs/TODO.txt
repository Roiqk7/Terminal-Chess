Goal: Create a simple demo where you can safely move across the app and have the basic GUI elements working.

- Improve error handling! Now it is not reliable
        - For some reason when error occurs in main menu the getInput() gets called which should not happen!
        - The error screen gets displayed usually too late

- Make sure there is no vulnerability/all the memory is safe.

- Add all the scenes except the Chess game.
        - Make sure you can move around the app and everything is nice.
- Add the Chess game.
        - Try to look for good and tested chess library.
- Improve help menu. Currently it is not really helpful.



- Once you can move around and everything is nice, add the actual Chess game and logic
        - Use this code for the actual chess functions: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214018/Chess-console-game-in-Cplusplus
        - And Stockfish for the AI.
