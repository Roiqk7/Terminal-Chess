Goal: Create a simple demo where you can safely move across the app and have the basic GUI elements working.

- Fix formatter base case when there is just 1 element in the scene
- Add exception events
- Make sure there is no vulnerability/all the memory is safe.
- Improve help menu. Currently it is not really helpful.
- Add all the scenes except the Chess game.
        - Make sure you can move around the app and everything is nice.



- Once you can move around and everything is nice, add the actual Chess game and logic
        - Use this code for the actual chess functions: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214018/Chess-console-game-in-Cplusplus
        - And Stockfish for the AI.
