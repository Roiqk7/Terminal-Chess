Goal: Create a simple demo where you can safely move across the app and have the basic GUI elements working.

- Update the recentEvents() method. It should not store the same event type multiple times in a row.
        - Once this is enabled you can safely used undo().
- Add universal keys for 'q', 'h' and 'x' to be available in all scenes.



- Once you can move around and everything is nice, add the actual Chess game and logic
        - Keep in mind that you would like to use Stockfish as an opponent
- Once you have working Chess game, polish everything and beautify the application.
        - Also do not forget to add custom help menus and all the other stuff you promise in the docs
