Goal: Create a simple demo where you can safely move across the app and have the basic GUI elements working.

- Add key binding 'r' to reset the GUI.
- Make sure there is no vulnerability/all the memory is safe.
- Improve help menu. Currently it is not really helpful.
- Add all the scenes except the Chess game.
        - Make sure you can move around the app and everything is nice.



- Once you can move around and everything is nice, add the actual Chess game and logic
        - Keep in mind that you would like to use Stockfish as an opponent
- Once you have working Chess game, polish everything and beautify the application.
        - Also do not forget to add custom help menus and all the other stuff you promise in the docs
