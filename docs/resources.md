## [Command Pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html)

This is a great article about the Command Pattern. It explains the pattern in a very simple way and provides a lot of examples. And I right away implemented it in my game. The `commands` I renamed to `events`. But the logic is the same.

## [Chess Library](https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library)

I want to give full credit to Disservin for his chess library. I used his library for most of the chess game. It really made my job easier!
